# MovieApp

This Android application is designed to display a list of movies fetched from an API and show detailed information about each movie on a separate screen. The architecture used in this project is based on Clean Architecture with MVI (Model-View-Intent) for better testability and scalability. It utilizes Hilt for dependency injection and Jetpack Compose for implementing the UI layer. Data fetching is done using the Retrofit library, and background requests are managed using Coroutines.
